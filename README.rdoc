== A Simple Test-Driven Ruby on Rails To-Do List Application

Ruby 2.0/Rails 4

This is a simple To-Do List style application with users being able to create multiple lists, add tasks to lists and share lists.
I'm using Aaron Sumner's brilliant book 'Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec' to get more familiarised with test driven development.

Notable Gems Used:

* RSpec
* Devise
* Factory Girl
* PostgreSQL
* Bootstrap Generator
